# CreditManagerApp

 

🧾 JimTech's Credit Manager 

The easy way to manage customer credits 

 Built with Python and Tkinter 

 

💡 About the Project 

JimTech's Credit Manager was born out of a real challenge I was facing in my small business: keeping track of customers who bought on credit. I initially started this project as a way to learn Python and understand file handling, but as the project evolved and my needs became more complex, I transitioned to using SQLite for more efficient data storage and querying. 

This journey helped me grow my skills in: 

Python GUI development with Tkinter 

Building CRUD systems 

Integrating SQLite3 for data persistence 

Designing intuitive user interfaces

📌 Notes 

The app is fully offline and stores data locally using SQLite. 

All records are saved in a .db file — no internet or cloud setup needed. 

Perfect for small shops, home businesses, or personal credit tracking. 

 

🛠️ Future Improvements 

Export reports to PDF/Excel 

Add customer notifications via email/SMS 

Add login/user roles 

Add cloud-based sync for multi-device access
